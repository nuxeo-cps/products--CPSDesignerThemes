CPSDesignerThemes Roadmap
=========================

    This is a draft. This roadmap rushes towards isofunctionality with
    CPSSkins, so that the product can be used and tested as a
    replacement ASAP. What happens after 0.4 is subject to discussion
    and can be redefined

    Version 0.1
    -----------

     - Compatibility mode for standard CPS pages, i.e., based on main_template
     - File system theme container (reads a configurable path,
    relative to INSTANCE_HOME)
     - No theme and page negociation (container's default/index.html)
     - (c)ElementTree engine

    Version 0.2
    -----------

     - Documentation for CPSDesignerThemes developers
     - engine refactoring and lxml engine
     - CPSSkins themes conversion
     - Ships with exported version of CPS 3.4 default theme
     - minimal negociation to render a bare CPS Default site (e.g.,
       front page). Hardcoded tolerated.


    Version 0.3 (quality milestone)
    -----------

     - Stabilisation of engine API and extensive unit testing.
     - Effort towards leverage of Zope component architecture where
    relevant, with future releases in mind
     - documentation for designers
     - Early adopters can start prototyping projects with the product

    Version 0.4
    -----------

     - Theme and page negociation, similar to CPSSkins'

    Version 0.5 (quality milestone)
    -------------------------------

     - Documentation for integrators, notably upgrade scenarios from CPSSkins
     - Suitable for pre-production by early adopters
     - Full iso-functionality with themes exported from CPSSkins.
     - CPSSkins still necessary for the portlets editor

    Version 0.5
    -----------

     - ZODB local themes with zip upload
     - much care to test that reverse proxying down inside the portal
     works
     - HTTP header negociation

    Version 0.6
    -----------

     - Portlets editor can work with CPSDesignerThemes
     - Inclusion in the CPS-3-full bundle (trunk)

As much point releases as necessary to reach

    Version 1.0 (production ready)
    -------------------------------

     - No feature
     - Documentation effort (online?)
     - Inclusion in the CPS-3-full bundle (3.4 branch)

    Version 1.1 (CPSDefault integration for 3.5)
    --------------------------------------------
    These are actually CPSDefault features, but that of course means that
    CPSDesignerThemes is ready for them

     - Conversion from CPSSkins themes as an upgrade step
     - CPSDefault's base profile switches to CPSDesignerThemes for
    next 3.5 release
     - Ships with an original CPS 3.5 theme
     - CPSDesignerThemes stays optional in the 3.4 branch

     Version 1.2
     -----------
       Optimization round-up. This is postponed so late because early
     tests suggest that an lxml based themes engine will run in epsilon time
     compared to the rest of CPS.

    Version 2.0
    -----------
     - Native hooking system (maybe something similar to <browser:page> ?)
     - Cleanup of as much Zope 2 idiomatics as possible in favor of
    Zope 3 / Five style
     - FTP access for ZODB local themes
     - UI improvements (loading by 3rd party URL, easy preview links...)
     - Online themes bank ?


Open ideas /questions
---------------------

     - i18n support (for the themes themselves), could be done in a
       static way with index_fr.html convention, meaning that
       index_fr.html is the default page for french version, or in a
       dynamical way (reducing duplication) with good old
       i18n:translate attributes
     - do we need a custom validator for the theme itself ? Is that even
       possible for additional namespace to declare new attributes on XHTML ?
