CPSDesignerThemes INSTALL
=========================

Dependencies
------------
   cElementTree 1.0.6 or plain Elementree 1.3

       Subversion checkouts are available here:
       http://svn.effbot.org/public/elementtree-1.3/
       http://svn.effbot.org/public/tags/celementtree-1.0.6-20090110-preview

       Documentation: http://effbot.org/zone/elementtree-13-intro.htm

   lxml is also needed to run the tests.

Installing
----------
   Import the CPS Designer Themes default profile

Where are the themes ?
----------------------
  They are loaded from Products/CPSDesignerThemes/doc/sample_themes
  To change that, go in ZMI to the .cps_themes object at the portal root

Disabling
---------
  In ZMI, go to the "Properties" tab of portal_skins.
  Remove 'cps_designer_themes_compat' from the two lists of layers

BUGS
====

  Entities
  --------

  on cElementTree, you'll get errors if there are HTML entities
  (such as &acute;) in the dynamic content generated by CPS.
  For now, you'll have to apply the provided patch (cElementTree.c.path) and
  recompile cElementTree to get rid of them

  Tests and lxml engine
  ---------------------
  All engine tests are ran for all engines.
  The lxml engine doesn't work yet, isn't hooked by default, and fails
  on some tests.

  lxml is also needed to run the doctests, but this has nothing to do
  with the lxml engine for CPSDesginerThemes.
