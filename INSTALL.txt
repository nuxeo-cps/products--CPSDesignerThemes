Dependencies
============

At least one of these XML processing libraries is required:

- lxml >= 2.2.2 (default)

  Details:
  Tested versions of the lxml package so far
  * on lxml 2.2.2 (homemade build on Ubuntu 9.04, Debian Etch, Lenny) -> works
  * on lxml 2.1.2 (MacOSX build by Plone buildout recipe) -> fails
  The discriminating issue between those versions is the following:
  http://osdir.com/ml/python.lxml.devel/2006-06/msg00084.html

- cElementTree >= 1.0.6 or plain Elementree >= 1.3

  Subversion checkouts are available here:
  http://svn.effbot.org/public/elementtree-1.3/
  http://svn.effbot.org/public/tags/celementtree-1.0.6-20090110-preview

  Documentation: http://effbot.org/zone/elementtree-13-intro.htm

  To run on (c)ElementTree, you have to edit
  ```configure.zcml```. See ```doc/engines.txt``` for details.
  Note that the default lxml-based engine
  is currently the most efficient and robust available.

Run the unit tests (see below) to know if your version works, and
don't hesitate to report the results.


Test dependencies
=================

The tests currently try and load all possible engines. Therefore, you'll need to
have both (c)ElementTree and lxml to run them. This could be lifted in the
future. Even if you deactivate the testing of lxml engines, lxml will still be
required, because it's been used by the testing infrastructure itself (to check
the output produced by the tested engine).

Installing
==========

Import the CPS Designer Themes default profile

Where are the themes ?
======================

The default setting is to load them from
Products/CPSDesignerThemes/doc/sample_themes
Check ```doc/themes_management.txt``` to learn in particular how to
configure that.

Disabling
=========

In ZMI, go to the "Properties" tab of portal_skins.
Remove 'cps_designer_themes_compat' from the two lists of layers

BUGS
====

Entities
--------

On cElementTree, you'll get errors if there are HTML entities (such as &acute;)
in the dynamic content generated by CPS. For now, you'll have to apply the
provided patch (cElementTree.c.path) and recompile cElementTree to get rid of
them.

Tests and engines
-----------------

All engine tests are ran for all engines.

lxml is also needed to run the doctests, to check output, but this has
nothing to do with the lxml-based theme engine.
