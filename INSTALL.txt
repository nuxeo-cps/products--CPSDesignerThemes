   Documentation: http://effbot.org/zone/elementtree-13-intro.htm

Installing

Where are the themes ?
----------------------
  They are loaded from Products/CPSDesignerThemes/doc/sample_themes
  To change that, go in ZMI to the .cps_themes object at the portal root

Disabling
---------
  In ZMI, go to the "Properties" tab of portal_skins.
  Remove 'cps_designer_themes_compat' from the two lists of layers

BUGS
====

As of 0.1, the main blockers for early testing purposes are:

  - error if CPS generated content includes XML entities
    other than &nbsp and the three XML common ones.
    (due to ElementTree)

  - error if you have a reference to the xhtml name space in
    your <html> tag. Just remove it as in doc/sample_themes/index.html

These should be fixed or behave diffently once the switch to lxml is
done. Fixing them at this point is a waste of time.
