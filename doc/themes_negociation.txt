Introduction
============

Negociation is the process of deciding which theme and page should be
applied on the current request.

In CPSDesignerThemes, the negociation is flexible and can be changed
through the Zope Component architecture. See at the end of this
section to learn how.

The standard (CPSSkins) negociator
==================================

We describe here shortly the standard negociator that ships with
CPSDesignerThemes : the CPSSkins Theme Negociator. As the name
suggests, this negociator is designed to be strictly compatible with
the negociation logic implemented in CPSSkins, the theme
engine that has been the standard system up to CPS 3.4.x series,
except of course that theme and page names must be taken in the sense
of CPSDesignerThemes : themes are toplevel file system folders
inside the area specified in the root container object
(``.cps_themes`` at the root of your portal).

TODO EXPAND CPSSkins part from CPSSkins doc.

Besides reimplementing the logic described in CPSSkins documentation,
this negociator adds the possibility to specify local method
themes. These bind the method used for publication (e.g, ``index_html``,
``folder_view``, ``folder_contents``...) to the theme and page, as in::

   folver_view:0-3:default+Front

This means "if the current method is folder_view, from this folder and
down to 3 levels below (inclusive), apply the ``Front`` page of
``default`` themes.

This is in particular how CPSSkins' global method themes are to be
translated into CPSDesigner ones. There's an upgrade step for that.


The Cherry Picking negociator
=============================
This negociator is *deprecated*. It had been introduced mainly to
support local method themes. Although deprecated, it is currently the
only builtin negociator that can bind a theme or page to a
non-folderish document.

Check the docstring of ``Products.CPSDesignerThemes.negociator`` for
more detail.

Changing the negociator
=======================

Negociators actually adapt a context and request to a theme engine.
For instance, to use the Cherry Picking negociator, put the following
in your Product's ``overrides.zcml``::

  <adapter
      provides="Products.CPSDesignerThemes.interfaces.IThemeEngine"
      for="OFS.interfaces.IObjectManager
	   zope.publisher.interfaces.http.IHTTPRequest"
      factory="Products.CPSDesignerThemes.negociator.CherryPickingCPSSkinsThemeNegociator"
      />

You can of course use the same principle to hook your own custom
negociator, or one that's been written by a third party.

Writing a custom negociator
===========================

Assuming using the root themes container only is enough for you, we
strongly suggest to subclass
``Products.CPSDesignerThemes.negociator.EngineAdapter`` and override
the ``getThemeAndPageName`` method.
