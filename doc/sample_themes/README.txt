About the sample themes
=======================

  Default theme
  -------------

	At this stage of CPS Designer Themes, the (ugly) sample
  default theme is nothing but a display of the capabilities.


  CPS 3.4 theme
  -------------

  It has been obtained by an early version of the CPSSkins export
  mode followed by manual editing, but it should work. Resources
  (images, stylesheets, scripts) are being referenced by the cps://
  URL scheme, meaning that they give rise to exactly the same
  HTTP requests as if it were the original.

  To use it, you need therefore to
     - have CPSSkins' portal_themes
     - have the default CPS 3.4 CPSSkins theme, *renamed* as cps3_4
     - update the Method Themes accordingly for the front page

  It would probably be better to get all the resources along the
  index.html and Front.html files, but this is not ready yet.
