Storage
=======

A theme is pretty much a static website, the only difference being that
html files are being written with special attributes to control
inclusion of dynamical content.

Themes are simply stored as directories on the Zope instance file
system. These are in turn all placed in the same themes directory.
The path to this themes directory can be configured in ZMI, on the
``.cps_themes`` object at the root of portal.
It is local to the Zope Instance, for security reasons,
but symbolic links are followed.
the system administrator can actually put the themes directory
anywhere and make a link in the Zope instance.

If you have a ZEO setup, then the themes should be deployed on
all clients machines. The themes directory can be shared among
instances on the same server. Symbolic links are supported.


Naming conventions
==================

 - A theme name is the name of the corresponding directory on the file system.
 - A page name corresponds to a file in the theme directory, with the
   html extension.

Example: the ``Front`` page of the ``cps3_4`` theme is located in
``<THEMES_DIRECTORY>/cps3_4/Front.html``

Negociation
===========

 Negociation is the action of choosing the proper theme and page for a
 given request.

 For the time being, CPSDesignerThemes leverages the CPSSkins
 negociator. In particular, Method Themes and local themes are
 supported. Check CPSSkins documentation for more details, keeping in
 mind that the theme and page concepts and names can be taken in the
 sense of CPSDesignerTHemes.

 The default theme and page are defined on the ``.cps_themes`` object.

Example:
--------

 The CPS 3.4 home page is assigned by CPSSkins to the ``Front`` page
 of the ``default`` theme. This is done in ``portal_themes``, on
 the "Method themes" tab.

 CPSDesignerThemes comes with two themes:

   - ``default``: ugly demonstration of capabilities, almost unusable.
   - ``cps3_4``: CPS 3.4 classical theme, exported from CPSSkins.

 To use ``cps3_4`` you have to:

   - go to the ``.root_themes`` object and change the default theme
     to ``cps3_4``.
   - go to the Method Themes of ``portal_themes`` and change the
     theme for the ``index_html`` method to ``cps3_4`` (you'll get a
     warning that cps3_4 isn't a CPSSkins theme).

 Without the second step, the portal's homepage would still be the one
 from the ``default`` themes.
